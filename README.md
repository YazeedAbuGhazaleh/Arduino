# Arduino
This is my first coding project. This project aims to create an entire intersection of traffic lights (4 traffic lights) which would fulfill the following requirements:

- The traffic lights should be coordinated perfectly. There should be no incidents of miscoordination, or any flaws which may result in a potential traffic hazard
- The system should be able to switch between at multiple traffic light queueing systems (e.g. one lane turning green at a time, and 2 parallel lanes turning green at the same time)
- The system should be able to detect any connection errors with cables or any other components, and take some kind of decision to ensure the safety of drivers
- The system should be coded efficiently so that the entire system can run on a single arduino
